[*Qwiic Multi Port Board (SPX-16906)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/16906)

Qwiic is a very efficient way to quickly prototype an idea but not all Qwiic devices have two ports. This Multiport board allows boards that have only one Qwiic port to be added to the I2C bus. Or, use this hub to add as many I2C devices to the bus as you need. Complete with mounting holes so the board can be added to any system.
